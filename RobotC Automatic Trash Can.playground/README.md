The Automatic Trash Can was a project I lead in my sophomore year.

We were assigned to make any sort of robotic system that could help out people. Think of it as a helper-bot.

I designed the automatic trash can. For fun, we decided to incorporate a basketball backboard and hoop to make the experience more
challenging and innovative.

The user would toss his/her trash through the basketball hoop, the trash can lid would open, and after five uses, it would empty the 
trash out.

A sonar sensor was placed in the hoop to determine when the trash fell through the hoop. 

Two motors attatched to two sliding doors made up the trash can's lid.

One servo motor controlling a trap door to empty the garbage out was placed at the bottom.
