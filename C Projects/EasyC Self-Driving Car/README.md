# EasyC Self-Driving Robot
The purpose of this project was to construct and program a self-driving robot (car) that can locate a red beacon and turn it off. 
Then, the robot will locate a green beacon and turn it off. 
Finally, the robot will exit the arena.

The robot used an IR board which would use ambient light in the room to help detect the beacons.

The project consisted of a team of six people. 
  + 2 people coding
  + 2 people soldering
  + 2 people constructing

I was part of the coding team and worked alone, even though 2 people were required. 
  + No one else had coding knowledge.
  + Therefore, 3 people worked on constructing

We were assigned the program EasyC for Vex Cortex Version 4. 
  + In an effort to eliminate cheating, the professor required block programming only.
  + Teams were only allowed to meet in the lab period, which was only once a week.
  + While there were many other computers in the Engineering building, only the computers in the class lab room held the EasyC V4 program.
    -->Therefore, coding could not be worked on outside of class.

In the code files, there is a class expose_and_read() which could not be recovered before school ended. 
  + I sincerely apologize for this incovenience.
