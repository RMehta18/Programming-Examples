# Programming-Examples
Coding Examples from various software programs such as RobotC, Eclipse, and XCode

If a file is saved under the file name "contents.swift", it is because most of the code is saved through the 
"playground" feature in XCode. 

**Please note that while it does say "contents.swift", it doesn't necessarily mean the language in the file is the language Swift**

XCode Playground is a basic compiler for practicing that presents itself as a good compromise software for storing code of 
many different languages. 

I also use XCode Playground to store most of my code from different projects.
