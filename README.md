# Programming-Examples
Coding Examples from various software programs such as RobotC, Eclipse, and XCode

Most files are saved under the file name "contents.swift". This is because most of the code is saved through the 
"playground" feature in XCode. 

**Please not that while it does say "contents.swift", it doesn't necessarily mean the language in the file is the language Swift**

XCode Playground is a basic compiler for practicing that presents itself as a good compromise software for storing code of 
many different languages. 

I also use XCode Playground to store all my code from different projects.
