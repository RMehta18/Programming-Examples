# Visualization

Visualization is the art of depicting large sets of data as pictures.

In this lab we used functions to create interesting colorful images. Hope you enjoy. 

The following .java files: Barnsley, Cantor, ComplexDynamicsFunction, WCF2 are all complex functions that paint a very interesting image.

Run the grader to test my code's accuracy :)
