#1.9 Python | Assuming you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a subtring of another and given two strings
# (s1 and s2), write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1.

def is_rotation(s1, s2):
  yesCount = 0
  noCount = 0
  for i in range(len(s1)):
    if (s1[i] in s2):
      yesCount += 1
    else:
      noCount += 1
      
  if (noCount != 0):
    print "No, s1 is not a rotation of s2"
  else:
    print "Yes, s1 is a rotation of s2"
    
# Disadvantage to this solution: larger time complexity
