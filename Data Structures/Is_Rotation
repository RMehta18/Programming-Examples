#1.9 Python | Assuming you have a method isSubstring which checks if one word is a subtring of another and given two strings
# (s1 and s2), write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1.

# a fairly simple way to solve the problem:
def is_rotation(s1, s2):
  if (s1 in s2):
    print "yes"
  else:
    print "no"

# the more advanced way to solve the problem:

def is_rotation(s1, s2):
  for i in range(len(s1)):
    if (s1[i] in s2):
      print "yes"
    else:
      print "no"
