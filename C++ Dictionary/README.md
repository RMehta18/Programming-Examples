# C++ Dictionary
Dictionary is composed of several classes, each serving their own function.

The purpose of this project was to create a book (which is stored using an ID) and a book name (description) and store it in a dictionary of books. The dictionary was meant to hold as many IDs and book descriptions as the user wanted. 

The user could also call back the ID and see the book description if desired.

Think of it as a book store.
